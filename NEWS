- Improve handling of layers in RVNGSVGPresentationGenerator.
- Handle master pages in RVNGSVGDrawingGenerator and
  RVNGSVGPresentationGenerator.
- Simple handling of tables in RVNGSVGDrawingGenerator and
  RVNGSVGPresentationGenerator: just create a text box for each cell.
- Fix return value of RVNGStringStream::seek when seeking to end.

- Really allow to disable build without streams and generators.
- Detect CppUnit in configure already.

  directory. Instead, create a valid dummy stream that will respond negatively

  neither API nor ABI.
- Add some documentation for RVNGBinaryData.
- Create a Coverity model covering the majority of librevenge data types, for
