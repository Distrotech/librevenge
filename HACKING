libwpd coding style
-------------------

Indentation/spacing: We indent with tabs. Not spaces. This decision is, of
course, rather contentious, but it does have the force of inertia going for
it. Try to keep lines less than 120 columns wide.

Naming: Version-specific classes, enumerations, and defines should be prefixed 
with 'WP', followed by the version number (e.g.: WP6, WP5, WP51, etc.). 
Generic classes (this includes utility abstractions like streams and strings) 
should be prefixed with WPX. 

For better worse, we have decided on using the camel caps convention for naming 
variables (i.e.: tempJustification). Use of hungarian notation (i.e.: iNum) is
forbidden, with one exception: use the 'm_' prefix for naming class and struct
variables (i.e.: my_class->m_var). Short-hand for variable names is allowed,
but don't overdo it (m_var->len() instead of m_variable->length() is ok,
m_nam instead of m_name is stupid). For WordPerfect-specific state, err on the 
side of verbosity (e.g.: names like 
WP6ParagraphGroup_RightMarginAdjustmentSubGroup are _good_), as the extra 
contextual information is useful when trying to decipher a convoluted piece of 
code in the libwpd parser.

Memory allocation: Use the C++ standard operations for this (new, delete). 
The rare use of realloc (and consequent use of malloc and free) in special 
cases is allowed (although using a data structure from the C++ standard library
is almost always preferable): take care not to mix and match C and C++ memory 
allocation functions in this case.

Data structures: Use the C++ standard library wherever appropriate and 
convenient. It should almost never be necessary to roll your own data 
structure.

Strings: You may use either the C++ standard strings or our very own 
UTF8-compliant WPXString. Hand-allocated char *'s are discouraged.

Further information: The OpenOffice.org (http://tools.openoffice.org/coding.html)
and AbiWord (cvs://cvs.abisource.com/abi/docs/AbiSourceCodeGuidelines.abw) 
contain lots of useful information that will make you a better C++ coder. 
Follow their advice religiously, except when they contradict something in this 
document.

Fun: Remember, the important thing is to have fun. :-) These rules are a means,
not an end. Happy hacking!
